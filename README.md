# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various deep learning techniques across different datasets. It explores how neural networks can model complex patterns in customer behavior to anticipate churn with high accuracy.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers. Accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave can help businesses take proactive measures to retain them, thus improving revenue and customer satisfaction.
